# Needle in a Haystack

## [DEMO](https://niah.abdulsadiq.com/)

## Description
_**Needle in a Haystack**_ is an app created specifically to aide in a doctoral thesis paper by Mashal Haque PhD. You can find the thesis paper here, entitlesd [Understanding Strategy Monitoring and Real-World Transfer in Cognitive Remediation Within the Context of Mood and Psychotic Disorders](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/handle/1974/31369).

## Development
*Needle in a Haystack* is made as a simple single page application, without the use of SPA frameworks. Instead, I used a webpack project in order to avoid the excess resources that come with modern SPAs.

The app gives the end user clear step-by-step instructions on each screen of the tests. In the first test, the user is given 3 minutes to select a target icon on as many game boards as they can. Note that the [demo available here](https://niah.abdulsadiq.com/) has a reduced timer for testing purposes.

After showing the user some quick stats from the first test, they are given instructions leading into the second. This time, the user is to select the target icon that appeasrs after another specific icon in the game boards. Once again, the user is given 3 minutes for this and shown the same stats after as well.

Deeper statistics are calculated by the app and sent to be stored in a dedicated database. Mashal collected these participants' data to further aide in her thesis.

## Built With
